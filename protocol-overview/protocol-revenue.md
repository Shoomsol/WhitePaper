# Protocol Revenue

Hylo is designed to generate revenue through two main channels: **mint/redeem** **fees** and **LST** **yield produced by the collateral pool**.

### LST Yield

The LSTs held in collateral pool are projected to yield a base APY between 8-11%. A large majority of this yield is allocated to those participating in the stability pool, with the remainder serving as a direct source of revenue for Hylo's treasury.

### Mint/Redeem Fees

Minting and redemption fees are the protocol's primary revenue stream. All trading transactions incur a fee on the order of basis points, with fees varying depending on health of the protocol. See [risk-management.md](risk-management.md "mention") for an overview of the fee structure.

As hyUSD gains distribution as a quoted asset for token pricing, the fee revenue stream may become more important than staking yield. Increased usage will create more arbitrage opportunities, leading to higher minting and redeeming volumes.
