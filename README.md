# Introduction

Welcome to Hylo's documentation! The goal of this site is to provide an accessible overview of Hylo's products with enough technical details about the underlying protocol to satisfy experienced investors and builders.

### What is Hylo?

Hylo is a suite of **Decentralized Finance** (DeFi) products on the Solana blockchain, engineered for scalability and independence from traditional financial infrastructure. In a nutshell, Hylo introduces an innovative decentralized stablecoin system consisting of two symbiotic tokens:

* **hyUSD**: A yield-bearing stablecoin backed by Solana liquid staking tokens (LSTs).
* **xSOL**: A tokenized asset enabling long term leveraged exposure to SOL.

### Guiding Principles

* **Solana Native:** We build performant products meant to compose, scale, and evolve with Solana DeFi.
* **Decentralized:** We do not rely on real world assets for collateral, instead using LSTs as "on chain bonds" to harness network yield.
* **Permissionless:** Our protocol is autonomous and self-contained. Hylo has no fund manager, third party trading dependencies, or trust gaps.
* **Secure:** Stability is maintained with financially incentivized risk management mechanisms. Slippage-free liquidity is guaranteed for both tokens at all times.
